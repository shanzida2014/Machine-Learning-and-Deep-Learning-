-- Many diseases occur due to a blood disorder. Such as haemophilia, blood clots, blood cancer etc.-- The diagnosis of these diseases involves to identify and characterize the patient's blood samples.-- One of the medical applications is to detect and classify blood cell subtypes.-- Here,I build a model using advanced AI which classifies four different white blood cell types.-- Doctors can use this model to identify disease from a sample of blood which he is not at all aware of, this helps him to better understand the disease and thus cures can be developed in a faster way.
